# Joining the Sustainability Track

Junction is an annual hackathon gather around 1'500 hackers for a weekend long experience. A place where designers, developers, and other techies team up to create new tech projects in 48 hours.

This time, my friend Matti and I joined to form a team, of all the 8 track we decided to join the sustainability challenge by CGI and K-Group.

This challenge pushed us invent a novel solution to support people in making daily choices that increases their health, reduces food waste, and support living a more sustainable lifestyle.
