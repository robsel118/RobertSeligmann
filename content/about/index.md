 A soon-to-be graduate of the __MSC__ in Computer Science at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/), my journey actually began at the [HES-SO Valais](https://www.hevs.ch/en/) where I studied Business Information Technology.

 I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities that will help me learn and grow as a person.

 Currently, I am open to new opportunities from freelance work to full-time contract.

 Thanks for viewing my portfolio!
