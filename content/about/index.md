Hello, I'm Robert, a recent graduate of the Master's program at Aalto University. Currently working at [Epassi](https://www.epassi.com/).

Since I was little, I was always fascinated by how some things were made, especially video games and movies. As a child, these seemed like sorcery to me, but when I decided to pursue a career in tech at HES-SO, I fell in love with programming and would spend most of my time working on school coding projects.

That path led to incredible opportunities that brought me to Finland and Japan. With my master's degree soon completed, I am looking for new challenges and opportunities that will help me learn and grow as a developer and as a person.


Some of the technologies I've been recently working with:
  - TypeScript
  - React.js
  - Node.js
  - Ruby on Rails
  - MySQL
  - SASS/CSS modules
  - Svelte.js
  - Figma
